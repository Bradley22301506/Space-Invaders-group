I have created a C# script that gives the player 3 lives when the game starts. 
If the enemies get too close to the player the player loses a life.
If the player loses all of the 3 lives, it's a game over. 

using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement; // To restart the game or load a game-over scene

public class PlayerLives : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int lives = 3; // Starting number of lives

    private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
    {
        // Check if the player collides with an enemy
        if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Enemy")
        {
            // Reduce player's lives
            lives--;

            Debug.Log("Player hit! Lives remaining: " + lives);

            // Check if player is out of lives
            if (lives <= 0)
            {
                Debug.Log("Game Over!");
                GameOver();
            }
        }
    }

    void GameOver()
    {
        // Restart the current scene (you can replace this with your own game-over logic)
        SceneManager.LoadScene(SceneManager.GetActiveScene().name);
    }
}

Explanation of the code:
I created a class for the player's lives. 
It creates a variable called "Lives" ands it sets it to 3 at the start of the game.
Now it checks whether the player collides with sprites that have "Enemy" has tag.
If this condition is met, it reduces the variable Lives by -1. 
If the player has 0 lives remaining, it sends me a print function to display that is game over.
