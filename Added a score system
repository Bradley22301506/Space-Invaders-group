I have added a score system in one of our previous code. It creates a variable that displays as an integer.
This text is a part that I named as "ScoreText". 
If the laser collides with sprites tagged as "Enemy", they laser will send a signal to update the score by 10.

using UnityEngine;
using TMPro;
public class PointManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int score;
    public TMP_Text scoreText;
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }
public void UpdateScore(int points)
{
    score += points;
    scoreText.text = "Score: " + score;

}

}

I have then adding a few more codes to displaying and updating the score where an ememy collides with bullets. The score goes up by 10.
using UnityEngine;

public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour
{

    public float moveSpeed;
    private PointManager pointManager;
  

    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        pointManager = GameObject.Find("PointManager").GetComponent<PointManager>();
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        transform.Translate(Vector2.up * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime);
    }

      private void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D collision)
    {
        if(collision.gameObject.tag == "Enemy")
        {
            Destroy(collision.gameObject);
            pointManager.UpdateScore(10);
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    
        if(collision.gameObject.tag == "Boundary")
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
}
