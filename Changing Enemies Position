I have created a spawn point for the enemies. 
So everytime the player collides with the enemies, the enemies will get teleported back to their oringinal spawn location. 

if (collision.gameObject.tag =="Player")
         {
            transform.position = new Vector2(0.15f, 3.31f);
            
        }

The code checks whether the player collides with the enemy.
If this condition is met, the enemies will change position.
